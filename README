   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   -> Active state:
      When SSPL is in active state, all the configured plugins including Storage
      Enclosure monitoring and Node monitoring are working.

   -> Degraded state:
      In Degraded state, plugins responsible for Storage Enclosure monitoring
      are suspended. Plugins in this state run but don't check for platform
      components state change and no alerts are raised.
