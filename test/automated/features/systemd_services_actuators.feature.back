Feature: Test Systemd Services Capabilities
	Send systemd service actuator messages to SSPL and verify action
	was correctly applied to the service.  Actuator messages for the
	SystemdService class are start | stop | restart | status

Scenario: Send SSPL a systemd service actuator message to restart chronyd service
	Given that the "chronyd" service is "running" and SSPL_LL is running
	When I send in the actuator message to "restart" the "chronyd.service"
	Then SSPL_LL "restart" the "chronyd.service" and I get the service is "active:running" response

Scenario: Send SSPL a systemd service actuator message to start chronyd service
	Given that the "chronyd" service is "halted" and SSPL_LL is running
	When I send in the actuator message to "start" the "chronyd.service"
	Then SSPL_LL "start" the "chronyd.service" and I get the service is "active:running" response

Scenario: Send SSPL a systemd service actuator message to stop chronyd service
	Given that the "chronyd" service is "running" and SSPL_LL is running
	When I send in the actuator message to "stop" the "chronyd.service"
	Then SSPL_LL "stop" the "chronyd.service" and I get the service is "inactive:dead" response

Scenario: Send SSPL a systemd service actuator message to get the status of halted chronyd service
	Given that the "chronyd" service is "halted" and SSPL_LL is running
	When I send in the actuator message to "status" the "chronyd.service"
	Then SSPL_LL "status" the "chronyd.service" and I get the service is "inactive:dead" response

Scenario: Send SSPL a systemd service actuator message to get the status of running chronyd service
	Given that the "chronyd" service is "running" and SSPL_LL is running
	When I send in the actuator message to "status" the "chronyd.service"
	Then SSPL_LL "status" the "chronyd.service" and I get the service is "active:running" response
